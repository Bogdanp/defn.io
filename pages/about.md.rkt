title: Hi!

You've reached Bogdan Popa's personal website. Welcome!

I've been working as a professional software engineer for the past
15 years. In that time span I have worked on a variety of problems
ranging from low-level video streaming on mobile devices to real time
analytics, device fingerprinting, landing page optimization, fraud
detection and scaling databases and systems containing hundreds of
terabytes of financial data.

For a while, I ran [Matchacha], a Romanian e-commerce business that
imported and sold Japanese green tea. I'm currently taking a break
from full time work and developing [Franz], a native desktop client
for Apache Kafka. I'm also working with [Marc Kaufmann] on [congame],
a platform for building & running economics studies. Previously, I was
Principal Engineer at [ServiceBell], I worked on _redacted_ at [Intuit],
I ran the API and data ingestion platform for [Nomics], I was the CTO of
[BlockFraud], and I was a Principal Engineer at [Leadpages].

In my free time, I like to contribute to the [Racket] programming
language and ecosystem. I maintain [koyo], [dramatiq], [molten] and a
bunch of other OSS which you can find on my [projects] page and on [my
GitHub profile][gh].

If you want to get in touch, [email] me. Find out about new posts by
subscribing to the [Atom] feed or follow me on [Mastodon] and [Bluesky].
