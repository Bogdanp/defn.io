I released [geoip] today. It's a Racket library for working with
MaxMind's geolocation databases. It's got a tiny API surface (3
functions!), but it should be useful to anyone needing to do geolocation
in Racket. As always, check it out and let me know what you think!

BTW, I streamed the whole process on [Twitch] so, if that's your thing,
you can check out the recordings [here][youtube].
