title: Screencast: Writing a Resource Pool Library for Racket

After hacking on [redis-lib] for a bit on Sunday, I decided to write
a general-purpose resource pooling library that I can re-use between
it and [http-easy] and I recorded the process. You can check it out on
[YouTube][video]:

     [:title "YouTube video player"]
     [:frameborder "0"]
     [:allow "accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"]
     [:allowfullscreen ""]))))

You can find the library on [GitHub][lib]. One particularly interesting
bit about the library, that I did not to record, is that [the
tests][tests] are all property-based. I might do another screencast at
some point to talk about how they work and the bugs they found in my
original implementation (from the video).
