title: Try Firefox

Since Microsoft officially announced that they will switch Edge's
rendering engine to Chromium, many people have written about how this
poses a danger to the future of the web.  I'm not going to repeat
those same arguments, as I feel [others] have done a good job of it.

What I want to do is urge you to try [Firefox] for a couple of days
this week.  That's it.  Give it a try.  More than the 15 minutes you
gave it that one time.  I bet you you'll find some things are better,
some are worse; but you might realize you like it.  You might also
find that that thing you only ever tested in Chrome doesn't quite work
as it should -- I found out my stock broker only supports Chrome --
and you might fix it and that might prompt you to test things in
multiple browsers in the future and we just might avoid a future where
the web is controlled by an ad-powered super-org.  Or don't.  It's up
to you.
