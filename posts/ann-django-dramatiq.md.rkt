This past week I released [django_dramatiq][djdramatiq], an app
that helps you integrate [Dramatiq][dramatiq] and [Django][django].
Additionally, I released these two example repos:

* [django_dramatiq_example][djdramatiq-example], a small Django app that
  shows off `django_dramatiq`, and
* [flask_dramatiq_example][fldramatiq-example], a small [Flask][flask]
  app that shows off how you can integrate Flask and Dramatiq.
