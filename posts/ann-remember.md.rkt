title: Announcing Remember for macOS

I've been using org-mode capture templates for years and I've always
wished I had something like that for the whole system. I took advantage
of the holiday break to build [Remember], a little reminders application
with Spotlight-like UX. It's available on Gumroad and you can pay what
you want for it (inlcuding $0!) at the moment so I hope you'll give it a
go!

Although the app isn't Open Source, it source code is available [on
GitHub][source]. Feel free to build, modify and run it yourself, but
please don't redistribute it.

P.S. the app is currently [on Product Hunt][ph] so if you have an
account there, feel free to leave a comment!
