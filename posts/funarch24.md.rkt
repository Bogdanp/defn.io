A couple weeks ago, [Marc Kafumann][marc] and I presented our paper,
[Continuations: What Have They Ever Done for Us?][acm], at [FUNARCH
'24][funarch]. The paper is a short experience report about our use
of continuations in [Congame] where we talk about the benefits of
using continuations to build a system like Congame, but also dive into
a couple problems we ran into. You can find the talk recording on
[YouTube][talk] and the paper is available for free on the ACM website.

Next week, I'll be giving an abridged version of the talk at
[OmniOpenCon] in Bucharest, so come say hi if you're attending.
