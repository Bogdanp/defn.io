These past couple of months, I've been working on a library for building
declarative GUIs in Racket. It's called [gui-easy] and it works by
wrapping `racket/gui`. See the [examples] directory to get an idea about
how it's meant to be used, or watch the demo below:

The library is still a work in progress so expect some breaking changes.
If you use it, let me know what you think!
