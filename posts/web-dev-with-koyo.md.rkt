Inspired by [Brian Adkins' RacketCon talk][talk] from yesterday, I
decided to record a screencast on what it's like to write a little
web application using my not-quite-a-web-framework, [koyo]. You can
watch it over on [YouTube][cast] and you can find the resulting code
on [GitHub][code]. It's unscripted and I don't go too deep on how
everything works, but hopefully it's easy enough to follow and I've left
the various mistakes I've made in since it's usually helpful to watch
someone get out of a tricky situation so look forward to those if you
watch it!
