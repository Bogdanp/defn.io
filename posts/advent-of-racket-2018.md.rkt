I decided to do this year's [Advent of Code] in [Racket] and stream
the whole thing. We'll see how far I make it (getting up this early is
*rough*!), but so far I finished day one. The code is [here][code] and
the playlist for the recordings is [here][rec].

If you want to get notified as soon as I jump on to start streaming, you
can follow me on [Twitch].
