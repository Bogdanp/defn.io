I released [component] the other day. It's a Racket library for managing
the lifecycle of stateful objects in long-running applications and for
doing dependency injection. It was inspired by the Clojure library of
the same name by Stuart Sierra. Check it out and let me know what you
think!

P.S. Expect more Racket libraries from me in the coming weeks and
months. I'm really enjoying the language so far!
